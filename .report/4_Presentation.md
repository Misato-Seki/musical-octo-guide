## üéØ Project title

API-Based Portfolio Management Tool

---

## üìù Project overview

This project aims to create a portfolio website along with an admin panel to manage the data displayed on the site. I already had a portfolio, but updating information required modifying the code directly, which was inconvenient. To solve this, I‚Äôm developing an admin panel that allows easy data management, and the frontend will fetch and display this data via an API.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Technical implementation

<!-- _Describe technologies used, architectural decisions, and how key features were implemented._ -->
### Admin Panel
- **Google Cloud Compute Engine**: Virtual machine (acts as a server)
- **Coolify**: Self-hosting support tool
- **Directus**: Headless CMS(Contents Management System)
- **PostgreSQL**: Database
- The Admin Panel is made by self-hosting **Directus** using **Coolify** within a virtual machine deployed on **Google Cloud Compute Engine**. The Docker setup for Directus specifies **PostgreSQL** as the database, which handles content storage and retrieval.

### Portfolio Page
- **React**: UI library for building interactive components
- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript**: Statically-typed JavaScript for improved code quality
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for React
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform optimized for Next.js applications
- The Portfolio Page is built using **React** and **Next.js**, with **TypeScript** for type safety and **TailwindCSS** for responsive styling. **Framer Motion** is used to add smooth animations, while **Vercel** is used to deploy the application.

## üöÇ Development process

<!-- _Summarize your progress from start to finish, mentioning key decisions or changes along the way._ -->
1. Initial Wireframing with Paper and Pen.
2. Considered developing the admin panel using Node.js and Express.js.
    - Decided against it due to the time required for development.
3. Considered using a CMS for admin panel development
    - Determined that using Google Cloud Virtual Machine, Coolify, and Directus CMS would be the most optimal solution.
    - It would allow for relatively easy and quick data management.
4. Used Directus to create the Admin Panel and entered information such as skills, projects, and work experience.
    - The data can be transferred to the Portfolio Page via an API.
5. Developed the Portfolio Page UI and integrated the API.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Reflection and future work

<!-- _What worked well? What challenges did you face? What would you add or improve in the future?_ -->
- All the planned features are working correctly.
- When I installed Coolify on a virtual machine in Google Cloud (GC) and used it to deploy Directus, I had a problem. Even though I followed the setup steps, the UI did not appear in the browser, and I got a 404 error. I found out that Google Cloud‚Äôs firewall was blocking external access. After I changed the firewall rules to open the correct port, the problem was solved.
- Right now, my portfolio website has a very minimal design. However, a portfolio is important for showing my skills. In the future, I want to add more graphic elements and improve the design to better show my design abilities.
